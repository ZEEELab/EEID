v0.8.1
  date Sep 9, 2015
		- Improved layout performance in some cases
		- Extended WebGL API to transform from/to webgl coordinates space
		- Custom shaders now receive layout's view of node position. This means
		that `y` coordinate needs to be replaced to `-y` in your custom shaders
		code
		- Bug fixes
		- Documentation updates
v0.7.7
  date Mar 24, 2015
	  - Upgraded to latest `ngraph` modules
		- Bug fixes
v0.7.0
  date Feb 4, 2015
	  - All files are now CommonJS Modules
		- `Viva.Graph.svg` is replaced with npm module `simplesvg`
		- `Viva.Graph.graph` is replaced with `ngraph.graph`
		- `Viva.Graph.generator` is replaced with `ngraph.generators`. This module
		contains all original graph + new graphs.
		Note: `randomNoLinks` is called `noLinks`.
    - `Viva.graph.Layout.forceDirected` is replaced with npm module
		'ngraph.forcelayout'. This module is faster than older one, and has better
		test coverage. Unfortunately this also means breaking changes:
		1. Instead of passing `link` object to `layout.getLinkPosition(link)`, you
		need to pas linkId: `layout.getLinkPosition(link.id)`.
		2. Instead of passing `node` object to `layout.setNodePosition(node, x, y)`
		use `layout.setNodePosition(node.id, x, y)`.
		3. Force based layout settings can be now accessed from `layout.simulator`:
			`layout.drag()` is now known as `simulator.dragCoeff()`
			`layout.springCoeff()` -> `simulator.springCoeff()`
			`layout.springLength()` -> `simulator.springLength()`
			`layout.gravity()` -> `simulator.gravity()`
			`layout.theta()` -> `simulator.theta()`
		- `Viva.Graph.Point2d` is removed. Use plain {x: 42, y: 42} object
		- `Viva.Graph.graph.addEventListener` is replaced with `on` method
		- `Viva.Graph.View.cssGraphcis` is deprecated
		- `Viva.Graph.View.svgNodeFactory` is deprecated
		- `geom.convexHull` is deprecated. Use https://github.com/anvaka/cnvx
		instead.
		- `Viva.Graph.community` is deprecated. Use https://github.com/anvaka/ngraph.slpa
		instead.

v0.6.0
  date Dec 27, 2014
	 - Migrated to gulp. First step towards commonjs.
	 - Fixed spelling, grammar.
v0.5.8
  date: Sep 28, 2014
	- Graphics object no longer waits `init` method to create container. Fixes
	https://github.com/anvaka/VivaGraphJS/issues/82
	- When renderer is paused clicking on any node will not reset it. Fixes
	https://github.com/anvaka/VivaGraphJS/issues/98
	- Calculating stable threshold based on absolute value. Fixes
	https://github.com/anvaka/VivaGraphJS/issues/100#issuecomment-55568513
	- Minor code style improvements

v0.5.6
  date: Apr 05, 2014
	- Using Object.create where possible to avoid node id collision with
	standard object property names (e.g. `constructor`)
	- Fixed bug in constant layout

v0.5.5
  date: Feb 22, 2014
	- Stable threshold can now be configured via options (Tnanks to @grnadav)

v0.5.4
  date: Feb 19, 2014
	- Webgl renderer supports centering API (Thanks to @sgerard)

v0.5.3
  date: Dec 27, 2013
	- Small clean up in renderer
	- Added pan/zoom API for SVG

v0.5.2
  date: Nov 23, 2013
	- Euler integrator now supports custom time step

v0.5.1
  date: Nov 20, 2013
	- Merged changes from v0.4.2: custom links length + fixed bug in arguments
	order

v0.5.0
  date: Oct 20, 2013
  BREAKING CHANGES:
  - graph.addNode() no longer augments old data model with whatever passed
    to method. Instead it stores direct reference to passed node's model
  - node/link objects no longer store layout specific properties. Instead you can
    query all layout properties from layout class itself. This allows the same
    graph to be layed out by two different layout algorithm, without stepping
    on toes of each other
  - node/link objects no longer store ui specific properties. Instead you
    can query them from specific UI provider

v0.4.2
  date: Nov 20, 2013
  changes:
    - Added customization point to force directed layout to allow specify custom links length.
    - Fixed a bug with wrong arguments order in physics simulator.

v0.4.1
  date: Jul 20, 2013
	changes:
	  - Layout algorithm now listens to changes from graph directly. Public API
		  to add/remove nodes or links is dropped from layout algorithms.
		- Added small performance test for node.js

v0.4.0
  date: April 7, 2013
  changes:
    - Migrated to grunt.js as a build system
    - Dropped jslint support in favor of jshint.
    - Cleaned up unused code:
        * GEM/ACE layout files are removed from repository. If you need them for
        the reference, please find them in the project's commits history.
        * Runge Kutta integrator is dropped
