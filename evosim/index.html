					<p class="uk-text-lead" id="page1" uk-scrollspy="cls: uk-animation-fade; repeat: true;">Life, uhh... finds a way.</p>
					
					<p>
						Let's put aside the argument whether viruses are alive or not for a second, and instead focus on one of their most important life-like characteristics: <b>Evolution</b>.  
					</p>

				    <p>
						<div class="uk-cover-container uk-box-shadow-medium" uk-scrollspy="cls: uk-animation-fade; repeat: true;">

						</div>
				    </p>

					<p>
						Evolution is one of those deceptively tricky topics that at first seems simple and intuitive. We can even boil it down into quips like <i>survival of the fittest</i> or, more accurately, <i>decent with modification</i>. The problem is that simple processes can give rise to incredibly complex and (yes I'm going to be that nerdy) beautiful patterns that challenge our intuition.
					</p>

					<p>
						This is one of the reasons why <a href="https://evolution.berkeley.edu/evolibrary/misconceptions_faq.php" class="uk-link-muted" target="_blank">misconceptions of evolution</a> are notorious problems for high school and university education. 
					</p>

					<p>
						Recently some unpublished research made a big media splash because it claimed that a new, more contagious, strain of SARS-CoV-2 (the virus that causes COVID-19) had been spreading. Evolutionary misconceptions became misinformation overnight. Thanks to an amazing community of scientists and science reporters, the claim was quickly addressed. My two favorites were this appropriately irate <a href="https://twitter.com/BrianRWasik/status/1257655037054128130?s=20" target="_blank" class="uk-link-muted">tweet thread</a> by Brian Wasik, and <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/health/archive/2020/05/coronavirus-strains-transmissible/611239/" target="_blank" class="uk-link-muted">this peice</a> in The Atlantic by the amazing Ed Yong. 

					</p>
					<p>
						This particular <b>Genotype</b> (not strain) is most likely increasing in frequency because it happened to be the lucky one that seeded an outbreak in a new location. This genotype's lucky break is an example of something we call <b>Founder Effects</b> in ecology and evolutionary biology. 
					</p>
					<p>
						Let's watch an evolving pathogen spread into multiple locations right here in your browser so you can see what founder effects look like!

					<p class="uk-text-lead" id="page2" uk-scrollspy="cls: uk-animation-fade; repeat: true;">Let's add a bit of realism to our browser world</p>
					
					<p>
						In the <a href="https://infectiousmatter.com/" target="_blank" class="uk-link-muted">last walk through</a>, we added multiple locations connected by random visitors. We're going to extend that a bit here. First, we're going to add <i>even more</i> locations. 
					</p>
					<p>

				    <p class="uk-text-lead" id="page3" uk-scrollspy="cls: uk-animation-fade; repeat: true;">Neighboring locations are more likely to share visitors</p>
 					
 					<p>
 						Let's turn on the contact graph so we can see how visitors moving locally between locations changes the network of interactions. 
 					</p>
 					<p>
 						Right now, there are no agents leaving their home location. The contact network has probably mostly floated off your screen. Each location has a tightly connected hairball network with no links to agents in neighboring locations.
 					</p>

 					<p>
 						Let's increase the number of <b>Local</b> visitors to about 10 by adjusting the slider. Watch the contact network as it floats back into view. Now that agents are leaving their home location, the contact network gets pulled back together. 
 					</p>
 					<div class="uk-container uk-flex">
				    	<p class="uk-margin-right"><b>Local Visitors Per Day:</b>
						    <div class="uk-form-width-medium">

							<span id="localMigrationBadge" class="uk-badge uk-badge-notification uk-padding-small">
								0
							</span>
						</div>
					</div>
					 <p>
 						 If you dial up the number of local visitors even higher, you can start to see the local network structure. It's a ring! Each location is connected to the two above and bellow it, and they wrap around from the bottom right to the top left (and vice versa).

				    <p class="uk-text-lead" id="page4" uk-scrollspy="cls: uk-animation-fade; repeat: true;">It's all connected!</p>
				    <p>
				    	We don't live in a hyper-local world, we travel outside of our immediate neighborhoods and sometimes even travel across the entire globe. We can simulate these kinds of long-range visits by moving an agent to a random location that isn't necessarily close.
 					</p>

 					<p>
 						I've reset the number of local visitors to 10, but now you can use the slider to adjust the number of <b>Global</b> visitors. 
 					</p>
 					<p>
 						First try adding just a couple of global visitors per day and watch what happens to the contact graph. 
 					</p>
 					<div class="uk-container uk-flex">
				    	<p class="uk-margin-right"><b>Global Visitors Per Day:</b>

					</div>
					 <p>
						 These long-range travelers quickly shrink the contact graph in the browser! You might think of these global links as <i>shortcuts</i> through the local ring-shaped network we saw earlier. As you might imagine, this makes getting from one location to another take less time. In a sense, we've made our simulated world <i>smaller</i>.
 					</p>
 					<p>
 						This type of network, where there is a strong local component with some global interactions, is called a Small World Network. It turns out these type of networks pop up all over the place: neurons, genes, electrical grids, and our Facebook social networks. Most importantly for us, the patterns of global travel also have these small world properties!

				    <p class="uk-text-lead" id="page6" uk-scrollspy="cls: uk-animation-fade; repeat: true;">Adding a Phylogenetic Network</p>
				    <p>
				    	To get a visual sense of the evolutionary dynamics going on in the pathogen population, we'll create a network depicting the genetic relationships between pathogens. For starters, we'll seed the world with two distinct pathogen genotypes. Each new infection gets a node in this phylogenetic network, and it's connected to the <b>Parent</b> genotype. Since we haven't enabled mutations yet, every node is connected to one of the two introduced pathogens.
				    </p>

				    <p>
				    	If you haven't already, try restarting the simulation and clicking the Infect Random Agent button several (>5) times.
				    </p>

				    <p>
				    	You probably noticed that some of the nodes were more active than others in the phylogenetic network and ended up with larger clumps. Those were the lucky genotypes that by chance spread to more locations and produced more offspring. However, these genotypes are functionally identical to each other. In microbiology lingo, they different genotypes of the same <b>Strain</b>.
				    </p>
				    <p>
				    	Now let's turn on the mutations! 
				    </p>
				</article>
			</div>

			<div uk-height-viewport>
				<article class="uk-article">

				    <h1 class="uk-article-title"><a class="uk-link-reset" href="">Mutant Pathogens</a></h1>

				    <p class="uk-text-lead" id="page7" uk-scrollspy="cls: uk-animation-fade; repeat: true;">
				    	
				    <p>
				    	Although we've enabled mutations, we're not changing any of the pathogen's biological features. We're not introducing any new strains. In fact, the only thing we're changing in this simulation is the color!
				    </p>
				    <p>
				    	Even so, you'll probably see what looks like a new strain spreading in the metapopulation! But, you're just watching founder effects in action. 

				    </p>
				    
				    <p>
				    	Be sure to investigate how the amount of local and global movement affects the spread of pathogen mutants. For example, what happens at the two extremes of only local or only global movement? Remember that this is a stochastic simulation, so you'll have to run the simulation a few times to get a sense of the range of possible outcomes. 
				    </p>

				    <p>
				    	It's easy to imagine seeing these patterns and wanting to attribute them to functional adaptations. However, in the case of SARS-CoV-2, there's really no evidence that we're facing multiple strains. Of course, that might change. We're probably all getting used to feeling like things we learned a week ago are already outdated. But for now, we can get back to arguing about whether viruses are alive or not.
